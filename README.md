# h1z1FontChanger
A small app to change the font on H1Z1 King of the kill  
*Made by Julien "fLaV" Delvaux*


# Version
This is the first version of the app.  
Further improvements will certainly come like :

- [ ] Insert a GUI to simplify the app
- [ ] Handle uncommon game paths
- [ ] Handle fonts which are not in the font folder
This list will be updated over the time.

# How to use it
The app is still in development.  
Altough you can download the app and run 
> app.exe

You need to put the font file (fontName.ttf) in the font folder.
The app will copy the font in the default h1z1 directory 
> C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/H1Z1 King of the Kill/UI/Resource/Fonts/

Feel free to ask me about this, or suggest ideas :)
