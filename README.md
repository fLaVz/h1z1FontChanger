# h1z1FontChanger
A small app to change the font on H1Z1 King of the kill.  
Made by *Julien "fLaV" Delvaux.*

# Version
This is the first version of the app.  
Further improvements will certainly come like :

- [x] Insert a GUI to simplify the app.
- [x] Handle uncommon game paths.
- [x] Handle fonts which are not in the font folder.  

This list could be updated over the time.

# How to use it
The app is still in development.  
Download the app and run :
> app.exe

- Choose the font via the explorer dialog.
- Locate your h1z1 font directory like :  
> C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/H1Z1 King of the Kill/UI/Resource/Fonts/
- Apply the fonts

Enjoy :)  
Feel free to ask me about this, or suggest ideas :)
